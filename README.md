# Sales-Funnel-Analysis-for-Hostel-Chain

### **Problem Description:**

SAPL, a provider of student hostels in India through their Rento platform, faced a challenge during the peak admission season. 
Despite a surge in web and app traffic and a substantial number of leads from diverse sources, the conversion rate of students actually joining SAPL was remarkably low at approximately 13%.

### **Live Dashboard:** 

### **Insights:**

- The company should focus mainly on agreement stage ( negotiation process ) and visited stage ( cancelled, missed, resheduled visits ) to improve the overall conversion rate which are major factors of low conversion.

- A marketing strategy is required to handle the seasonality pattern observed as the leads are continuously dropping after the month of March.

- Regional demands should be observed and good efforts should be made by team for better lead conversion.
