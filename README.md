# Sales-Funnel-Analysis-for-Hostel-Chain

### **Problem Description:**

SAPL, a provider of student hostels in India through their Rento platform, faced a challenge during the peak admission season. 
Despite a surge in web and app traffic and a substantial number of leads from diverse sources, the conversion rate of students actually joining SAPL was remarkably low at approximately 13%.

### **Analysis:**
A dashboard is prepared using PowerBI which displays the sales funnel, conversion rates for each city, count of leads over time, and more visuals to find the cause of the low conversion rate.

### **Insights:**

- The company should focus mainly on the agreement stage ( negotiation process ) and visited stage (canceled, missed, rescheduled visits ) to improve the overall conversion rate which are major factors of low conversion.

- A marketing strategy is required to handle the seasonality pattern observed as the leads are continuously dropping after the month of March.

- Regional demands should be observed and good efforts should be made by the team for better lead conversion.
